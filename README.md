# Restaurant-mini-app
This is a small Python project for my uni. A restaurant app that allows customers to place orders or make adjustments to their receipt, and gives the admin the ability to update the menu, check the app's log, and so on. This is my first project on GitHub, I hope you like it. I'd be glad to receive any advice or tips on improving my code.
